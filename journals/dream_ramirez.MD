Today, I worked on:

* Planning api for posts

I'm responsible for Posts api. The user stories I come up with include "as a
user, I can create a post," "as a owner of a post, I can edit my post," "as a owner of a post, I can delete my post," and "as a user, I can see all the posts"

Today, I worked on:

* Create posts endpoint

The thing that's blocking me is how to add user data to my posts. I watch Curtis' video about FastAPI - Complex Models, I kinda understand that I can create a class that has user models in it then use it as a type of data in my posts base model. Then I have to also think of how two databases connect to each other in order to get user as foreign key
