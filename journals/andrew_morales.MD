# Journa;

## June 29th:

- I created a working create user endpoint without authentication, to demonstrate my ability to use FastAPI and PostgreSQL. FastAPI is a lot different than Django but it seems easy to use once you get used to it. Little did I know about the problems I would face regarding migrations when updating the user table to include role and hashed password.

## June 30th:

- I created a working update user endpoint for the first users table. I will need to update it once we implement authentication.
